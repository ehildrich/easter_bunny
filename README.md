# E.B.
E.B.: The Easter Bunny was made for the ACM's Spring 2024 game jam at Truman State University. It stars Bunny the alien, who must retrieve her 4 eggs and return to her ship before running out of energy. 

## How to Run the Game
* Download the code as a ZIP file
* Unzip the file into a folder
* Run bunny.exe
* Press the power button (space) on the title screen to begin the game

## Controls
This game only uses the four arrow keys (or WASD) to move and the spacebar to use Bunny's various powers. On the top right of the screen is a box, inside of which will flash various icons. Press the spacebar while in one of these power zones to use the associated power. 

## How to Win
There are four zones covered in pits. One of the pits on each screen contains an egg. Press the power button in a pit any time to float back out of it. Once you are out, press the spacebar again to stop floating. Obtain all four eggs and then locate the landing power zone (indicated by a recitle icon) back in the forest where you landed. Your ship will come pick you up and the round will be over. Your score will be shown to you, and you may then press the power button to start another round. Keep going to rack up a high score! 

Each round, you will start with 9999 energy. Energy is depleted by moving around, being in pits, being touched by an enemy, or using a power. There is no way to replenish your energy, so try to conserve it! Once you run out, Bunny will get too tired to keep going, and the game will be over. Press the power button to see your final score and return to the title screen. 

### Power Zones
All power zones cost 100 energy to use, so use them wisely when your energy is running low! 

* Egg Zone - All pits on the current screen which contain an egg will be revealed.
* Candy Zone - Extra candies will be scattered about the current scene. Each of these zones can only be used once per round!
* Twister Zone - Any agents or scientists will become confused and run away from you. 
* Landing Zone - Only found in the forest. If you have all four eggs, this zone will call your ship and you'll win the round. 

## Enemies
There are two types of enemies: Agents and Scientists. Both will take a little bit of energy, but the Scientist will steal some of your candy while the Agent will take one of your eggs and hide it in a random pit.
