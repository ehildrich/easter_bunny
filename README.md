# E.B.
E.B.: The Easter Bunny was made for the ACM's Spring 2024 game jam at Truman State University. It stars Bunny the alien, who must retrieve her 4 eggs and return to her ship before running out of energy. 

## Controls
This game only uses the four arrow keys (or WASD) to move and the spacebar to use Bunny's various powers. On the top right of the screen is a box, inside of which will flash various icons. Press the spacebar while in one of these power zones to use the associated power. 

## How to Win
There are four zones covered in pits. One of the pits on each screen contains an egg. Press the power button in a pit any time to float back out of it. Once you are out, press the spacebar again to stop floating. Obtain all four eggs and then locate the landing power zone (indicated by a recitle icon) back in the forest where you landed. Your ship will come pick you up and the round will be over. Your score will be shown to you, and you may then press the power button to start another round. Keep going to rack up a high score! 

## Enemies
There are two types of enemies: Agents and Scientists. Both will take a little bit of energy, but the Scientist will steal some of your candy while the Agent will take one of your eggs and hide it in a random pit.
